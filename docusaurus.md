## Introduction

This part is not included in the OVA file because it contains SSH KEYS and GitHub account information. This part will use the user account "cbkadal" as an example. Remember, you are not "cbkadal," so you should replace "cbkadal" with your account. 
Again, you are not "cbkadal," so you should replace "cbkadal" with your account.

## GitHub and SSH
* In this example, we will use GitHub account "cbkadal" and repo <https://github.com/yforku/DocuDemo/>.
  You should replace it with your own. See also [README](README.md#idx03).
